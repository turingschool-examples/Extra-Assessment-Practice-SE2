# Extra-Assessment-Practice-SE2

These prompts provide additional assessment-style practice for data manipulation with JS prototype methods.

Pay close attention to what the prompts are asking you.  When in doubt, post a clarifying question in Slack.

There is no test suite to accompany these prompts.  Pay close attention to detail to ensure your result is the expected result.

Each folder has:  
- a markdown file with prompts that build level by level
- a js file where you will write your code solutions to those prompts

## Set Up

- Fork this repo (do not clone)
- clone your forked copy to your machine
- `cd` into the directory for the project
- run `npm install`

Each markdown file contains the terminal command to run the code in its corresponding js file.

Note: Some prompts are working with an object dataset.  You may, or may not, need to reach for Object.keys().  

🚨**Object.keys() will not be needed for your midmod or final assessments.** 

The methods you **do** need to be comfortable with for assessments are:
- forEach
- filter
- reduce
- map
- sort
- includes
- split 
- join
